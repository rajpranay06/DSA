'''

Given the heads of two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. 
The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

Input Format: 
(Pointer/Access to the head of the two linked lists)

num1  = 243, num2 = 564

l1 = [2,4,3]
l2 = [5,6,4]

Result: sum = 807; L = [7,0,8]

Explanation: Since the digits are stored in reverse order, reverse the numbers first to get the original number and then add them as â†’ 342 + 465 = 807.

Elementary Math

Intuition: Keep track of the carry using a variable and simulate digits-by-digits sum starting from the head of the list, which contains the least significant digit.

class Solution:

    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: Optional[ListNode], l2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        carry = 0

        dummy = ListNode(-1)
        temp = dummy

        while l1 or l2 or carry:
            s = 0
            if l1:
                s += l1.val
                l1 = l1.next
            if l2:
                s += l2.val
                l2 = l2.next
            
            s += carry

            node = ListNode(s%10)
            temp.next = node
            carry = s//10

            temp = temp.next
        
        return dummy.next

'''

Time Complexity: O(max(m,n)). Assume that m and n represent the length of l1 and l2 respectively, the algorithm above iterates at most max(m,n) times.

Space Complexity: O(max(m,n)). The length of the new list is at most max(m,n)+1.
