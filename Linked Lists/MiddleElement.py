Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list. If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

Tortoise-Hare-Approach

Unlike the above approach, we donâ€™t have to maintain node count here and we will be able to find the middle node in a single traversal so this approach is more efficient.

Intuition: In the Tortoise-Hare approach, we increment slow ptr by 1 and fast ptr by 2, so if take a close look fast ptr will travel double that of the slow pointer. 
So when the fast ptr will be at the end of the Linked List, slow ptr would have covered half of the Linked List till then. So slow ptr will be pointing towards the middle of Linked List.

Time Complexity: O(N)

Space Complexity: O(1)
