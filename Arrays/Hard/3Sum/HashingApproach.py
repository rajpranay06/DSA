Given an array of N integers, your task is to find unique triplets that add up to give a sum of zero. 
In short, you need to return an array of all the unique triplets [arr[a], arr[b], arr[c]] such that i!=j, j!=k, k!=i, and their sum is equal to zero.

Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
Explanation: 
nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].
Notice that the order of the output and the order of the triplets does not matter.

Intuition:
In the brute force approach, we use 3 loops, but now our goal is to reduce it to 2 loops. To achieve this, we need to find a way to calculate arr[k] since we intend to eliminate the third loop (k loop). 
To calculate arr[k], we can derive a formula as follows: 

arr[k] = target – (arr[i]+arr[j]+arr[k]) = 0-(arr[i]+arr[j]+arr[k]) = -(arr[i]+arr[j]+arr[k]) 

So, we will first calculate arr[i] and arr[j] using 2 loops and for the third one i.e. arr[k] we will not use another loop and instead we will look up the value 0-(arr[i]+arr[j]+arr[k]) in the set data structure. 
Thus we can remove the third loop from the algorithm.

For implementing the search operation of the third element,  we will store all the elements between the indices i and j in a HashSet and then we will search for the third element in the HashSet.

def triplet(n, arr):
    st = set()

    for i in range(n):
        hashset = set()
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            # Calculate the 3rd element:
            third = -(arr[i] + arr[j])

            # Find the element in the set:
            if third in hashset:
                temp = [arr[i], arr[j], third]
                temp.sort()
                st.add(tuple(temp))
            hashset.add(arr[j])

    # store the set in the answer:
    ans = list(st)
    return ans

'''

Time Complexity: O(N2 * log(no. of unique triplets)), where N = size of the array.
Reason: Here, we are mainly using 3 nested loops. And inserting triplets into the set takes O(log(no. of unique triplets)) time complexity. 
But we are not considering the time complexity of sorting as we are just sorting 3 elements every time.

Space Complexity: O(2 * no. of the unique triplets) + O(N) as we are using a set data structure and a list to store the triplets and extra O(N) for storing the array elements in another set.
