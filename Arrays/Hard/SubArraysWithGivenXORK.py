Given an array of integers A and an integer B. Find the total number of subarrays having bitwise XOR of all elements equal to k.

Pre-requisite: Find the number of subarrays with the sum K 

Input Format: A = [4, 2, 2, 6, 4] , k = 6
Result: 4
Explanation: The subarrays having XOR of their elements as 6 are  [4, 2], [4, 2, 2, 6, 4], [2, 2, 6], [6]

Using Hashing:

Similar to number of subarrays with the sum K.

Approach:
The steps are as follows:

First, we will declare a map to store the prefix XORs and their counts.
Then, we will set the value of 0 as 1 on the map.
Then we will run a loop(say i) from index 0 to n-1(n = size of the array).
For each index i, we will do the following:
We will XOR the current element i.e. arr[i] to the existing prefix XOR.
Then we will calculate the prefix XOR i.e. xr^k, for which we need the occurrence.
We will add the occurrence of the prefix XOR xr^k i.e. mpp[xr^k] to our answer.
Then we will store the current prefix XOR, xr in the map increasing its occurrence by 1.

def subarraysWithXorK(a: [int], b: int) -> int:
    n = len(a) # size of the given array.
    xr = 0
    mpp = defaultdict(int) # declaring the dictionary.
    mpp[xr] = 1 # setting the value of 0.
    cnt = 0

    for i in range(n):
        # prefix XOR till index i:
        xr = xr ^ a[i]

        # By formula: x = xr^k:
        x = xr ^ k

        # add the occurrence of xr^k
        # to the count:
        cnt += mpp[x]

        # Insert the prefix xor till index i
        # into the dictionary:
        mpp[xr] += 1

    return cnt

Time Complexity: O(N)

Space Complexity: O(N) as we are using a map data structure.
