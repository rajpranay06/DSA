'''
Given row number r and column number c. Print the element at position (r, c) in Pascalâ€™s triangle.

N = 5, r = 5, c = 3
Result: 6

Approach:
The steps are as follows:

First, we will consider r-1 as n and c-1 as r.
After that, we will simply calculate the value of the combination using a loop. 
The loop will run from 0 to r. And in each iteration, we will multiply (n-i) with the result and divide the result by (i+1).
Finally, the calculated value of the combination will be our answer.

'''

def nCr(n, r):
    res = 1

    # calculating nCr:
    for i in range(r):
        res = res * (n - i)
        res = res // (i + 1)

    return res

def pascalTriangle(r, c):
    element = nCr(r - 1, c - 1)
    return element

'''

Time Complexity: O(c), where c = given column number.
Reason: We are running a loop for r times, where r is c-1.

Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space.
