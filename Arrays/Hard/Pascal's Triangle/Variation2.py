Given the row number n. Print the n-th row of Pascalâ€™s triangle.

Input Format: N = 5, r = 5, c = 3
Result: 1 4 6 4 1

Approach:
The steps are as follows:

First, we will print the 1st element i.e. 1 manually.
After that, we will use a loop(say i) that runs from 1 to n-1. It will print the rest of the elements.
Inside the loop, we will use the above-said formula to print the element. We will multiply the previous answer by (n-i) and then divide it by i itself.
Thus, the entire row will be printed.

'''

def pascalTriangle(n):
    ans = 1
    print(ans, end=" ") # printing 1st element

    #Printing the rest of the part:
    for i in range(1, n):
        ans = ans * (n - i)
        ans = ans // i
        print(ans, end=" ")
    print()

Time Complexity: O(N) where N = given row number. Here we are using only a single loop.

Space Complexity: O(1) as we not using any extra space.
