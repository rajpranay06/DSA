'''
Time Complexity: O(N) or O(N*logN) depending on which map data structure we are using, where N = size of the array.
Reason: For example, if we are using an unordered_map data structure in C++ the time complexity will be O(N)(though in the worst case, unordered_map takes O(N) to find an element and the time complexity becomes O(N2)) but if we are using a map data structure, the time complexity will be O(N*logN). The least complexity will be O(N) as we are using a loop to traverse the array.

Space Complexity: O(N) as we are using a map data structure.
