'''
Given an array consisting of only 0s, 1s, and 2s. Write a program to in-place sort the array without using inbuilt sort functions. ( Expected: Single pass-O(N) and constant space)

'''
Time Complexity: O(N) + O(N), where N = size of the array. First O(N) for counting the number of 0’s, 1’s, 2’s, and second O(N) for placing them correctly in the original array.

Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space.
