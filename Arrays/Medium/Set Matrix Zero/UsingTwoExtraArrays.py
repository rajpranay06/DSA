Given a matrix if an element in the matrix is 0 then you will have to set its entire column and row to 0 and then return the matrix.

Input: matrix=[[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]

Output: [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]

Explanation: Since matrix[2][2]=0.Therfore the 2nd column and 2nd row wil be set to 0.

Approach (Using two extra arrays):

The steps are as follows:

First, we will declare two arrays: a row array of size N and a col array of size M and both are initialized with 0.
Then, we will use two loops(nested loops) to traverse all the cells of the matrix.
If any cell (i,j) contains the value 0, we will mark ith index of row array i.e. row[i] and jth index of col array col[j] as 1. 
It signifies that all the elements in the ith row and jth column will be 0 in the final matrix.
We will perform step 3 for every cell containing 0.
Finally, we will again traverse the entire matrix and we will put 0 into all the cells (i, j) for which either row[i] or col[j] is marked as 1.
Thus we will get our final matrix.

def zeroMatrix(matrix, n, m):
    row = [0] * n  # row array
    col = [0] * m  # col array

    # Traverse the matrix:
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if matrix[i][j] == 0:
                # mark ith index of row wih 1:
                row[i] = 1

                # mark jth index of col wih 1:
                col[j] = 1

    # Finally, mark all (i, j) as 0
    # if row[i] or col[j] is marked with 1.
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if row[i] or col[j]:
                matrix[i][j] = 0

    return matrix

'''
Time Complexity: O(2*(N*M)), where N = no. of rows in the matrix and M = no. of columns in the matrix.
Reason: We are traversing the entire matrix 2 times and each traversal is taking O(N*M) time complexity.

Space Complexity: O(N) + O(M), where N = no. of rows in the matrix and M = no. of columns in the matrix.
Reason: O(N) is for using the row array and O(M) is for using the col array.
